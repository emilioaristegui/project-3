# Project-3
Global Emissions

## Background
The aim of our project is to discover which countries contribute more to global pollution. We will analyze which industries contribute more and which segments contribute the most. Finally we will plot a regression analysis for overall global pollution for the next 5 years.

- Which countries pollute the most?
  
- Which type causes the most pollution? 
    
- Which segment causes the most pollution? histogram**
    
- Regression

## Initial Requirements
Tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:
- Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
- A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
- SELECTED: A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
- A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

- Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
- Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
- Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
- Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Focus your efforts within a specific industry:
- SELECTED: Energy

## Guidelines:

1. Check for copyright protections, and make sure that the way you plan to use this dataset is within the bounds of fair use. 
- Data is from kaggle and it provides the source: International Energy Agency
2. Document how you intend to use this dataset now and in the future. Find any licenses or terms of use associated with the dataset, and review them to confirm that your intended use is in compliance.
3. Investigate how the dataset was collected. Identify any indicators that the data was obtained from a source that the compilers were not authorized to access.

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
- Jupyter Notebook
- The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases:
    - (1) exploration and cleanup.
    - (2) analysis.
- Aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis.
- Plots during both the exploration and analysis phases.

## Technical Requirements

### Data and Delivery

- Data components used in the project are clearly documented. 
- The dataset contains at least 100 unique records.
- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
- The project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen database. 

### Back End

- The page created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 
- A JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. 
- The project conforms to one of the following designs:
    - A Leaflet or Plotly chart built from data gathered through web scraping
    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data

### Visualizations

- A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
- Multiple user-driven interactions (such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature) are included on the final page.
- The final page displays visualizations in a clear, digestible manner. 
- The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. 

### Group Presentation

- All group members speak during the presentation. 
- The content is relevant to the project. 
- The presentation maintains audience interest. 
- Content, transitions, and conclusions flow smoothly within any time restrictions.
